# Storyslider
A responsive Instagram Story like slider

Created by @origamid and (hopefully) improved by me.

Main changes & additions are: <br/>
-> 100% working progress bars at the top, which previously didn't indicate the previous images having passed <br/>
-> Slider always being centered <br/>
-> Slider now does not extend past the height of the screen <br/> 
-> Exit button to exit the slider & go back to the previous page <br/>

I'm currently still working on improving it more & adding comments when I'm less busy :)
